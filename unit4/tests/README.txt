i have met some problem about the system which can't install the module automatically in the virtual machine, and this module
in my code is matplotlib, i don't know how to operate the travis CI to pip install it so i have to wipe some relative codes out and 
i can't have some picture in that website, but it doesn't mean there are some mathmatic wrong in my code, because my computer
has installed the tensflow and matplotlib so if i use the pytest directly, it will work, so i suggest run the pytest directly instead of the
travis, sincerely.
