# SES2020spring

## Introduction

This repository contains the complementary material for 项目实践 in 2020 spring.
Due to the distributed and
asynchronous
nature of this study format, we will steer the course through a series of self-contained units around programming, visualization, and simulation, which may be your interest for your future endeavor or not. This course tries to fulfill this arrangement by introducing some tools and demonstrating their capacity. 

4 units are planned for the first 4 weeks. Each unit will contain at least 2 parts. The 1st part will discuss general practice and methodology around software engineering and this serves as the general topic across the board. The second part will introduce some tools or library and show how to use them. It’s highly recommended that you should do your research about this tool or library before the classroom and practice with it after the class. The classroom time will be question/answer time and I will stay online to answer your question through Github issues, QQ, and Wechat.

## Unit 1: Introduction to Software Engineering and Git

In the introduction to software engneering, we will cover the concept of software, software engineering, and software crisis. We also show the basic workflow of Git, the distributed version control system.

## Unit 2: Agile Programming

We will have 2 parts in this unit. In the first part, we go through an agile method called Scrum. In this second part, we will talk about Python.
