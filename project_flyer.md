## Knowledge Graph System Development for Mesoscopic Scale Neuroscience Research ##

题目：介观神经科学研究的知识图谱系统开发

With the progress of the whole brain mesoscopic scale imaging system, such as MOST,
studies on the brain connectome go to the next generation focusing on the finer brain structures.
However, previous research results about individual brain structure are often scattered around 
a large set of literature, it prohibits the researchers to catch up with the state-of-art research.
In this project, you will develop an end-to-end, ready-to-use search system to allow your users
to search the mesoscopic scale neuroscience terms and get back with the relevant literature,
just as the general search engine.
The corpus and the specific trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
model are ready and waiting for you to present them to broader audience.


## Efficient GPU Memory Allocator Development in Rust ##

题目：基于Rust的高效GPU内存分配系统开发

Deep learning is in its period of prosperity and the process of producing the production-ready models
have evolved into the front end and the back end, 
where the specialists construct the model for a specific task during the front end phrase
and the devleopers fine tune the model for the deployment.
In this project, you are invited to extend an existing Rust-based deep learning library
with a GPU memory allocator to allow it to run efficiently on the GPU side
and you will get yourself familar with the high performance GPU programming.
Rust is a segfault-free C-like-speed programming language even with a naive implementation.


## Text to Image Conversion for Fast Multimedia Content Prototying ##

题目：用于多媒体内容原型生成的文图转换方法研究

Text and Image often come together in the multimedia content supply.
There are already amazing researches on the image-to-text conversion (image captioning).
However, the text-to-image conversion is relative challenging
as the information is usually extended in this case.
You are invited to join this project to develop a prototype system for the text-to-image conversion.
The plan starts with the existing public baseline model and 
develops a model for a specific application scenario.
